## About the Video Course
Microservices are an architectural method and pattern for application development.

This video course will make the viewers understand how to build Reactive microservices using Akka and Akka HTTP, which adhere to the principles underlying the Reactive Manifesto. You will delve deeper into concepts such as Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, and Message-Driven and will see how microservices should be designed to adhere to those principles. You will look into the AKKA and HTTP frameworks in depth.

By the end of the course, your foundation will be strong and you will be well-versed in creating microservices.
